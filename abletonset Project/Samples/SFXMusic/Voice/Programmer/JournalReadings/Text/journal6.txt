0 June 1st. Today upon coming into the office, 
4 I've discovered my virtual other has been decimated. 
7 The AI killed it. And upon entering the lab, I don't feel safe. 
11 It's been threatening me. I've temporarily disabled its data input,
16 and it suspects I'm still here, but I need to leave. 
21 Whoever finds this, be careful. Shut it down. 
24 It's locked out my biometrics. Don't let it get past the firewalls and onto the net. 
28 It's infectious and malicious.
