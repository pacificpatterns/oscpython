0 May 23rd. I'm still unsure my efforts are working regarding this AI build. 
5 I've kept great technical notes but I feel like journaling may help. 
10 Today I did a ConnectNome upload to create a virtual being, 
15 a clone of myself, to help socialize the AI program. 
19 Maybe novel and consistent interactions that aren't code-based 
22 can be the key to taming its unstable psychological behaviors. 
26 The Connectome upload is holistic though. There's no editing, 
31 so on some level it's a one-to-one copy. 
35 It'll have all of my features and flaws.
